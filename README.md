#Instruction
Checkers is a strategy board game for two players which involves diagonal moves of uniform game pieces and mandatory captures by jumping over opponent pieces. 
There are 4 important move rules which are:
1. Checkers can only move diagonally on dark squares.
2. At the start of the game, checkers can only move forward, meaning toward the opposite player's side.
3. Checkers may move both up and down when they become “kings” by reaching the last row of the opposite side.
4. Capturing pieces is not forced in this rule set, and continuous capturing is not allowed. (Diffrent from first design)

In this code, we run the game by running main part of game.java and play checker as 2 loacal players.
The game will end when one side is out of pieces to play.
